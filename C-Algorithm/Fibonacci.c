/*
Exercise: Fibonacci Sequence

Write a program that prints the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence, where n is a number entered by the user.

The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the two previous numbers. The Fibonacci sequence looks like this:

Copiar cÃ³digo
0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, ...

Requirements

The program should prompt the user to enter a positive integer n, which represents the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence to be printed.
If the user enters a number less than or equal to 0, the program should display an error message indicating that the number must be positive.
Once the user enters a valid number, the program should calculate and print the first n numbers in the Fibonacci sequence in a single line, separated by spaces.
Example Execution
If the user enters the number 7, the program output should be:

Enter the number of Fibonacci sequence terms to print: 7
Fibonacci sequence: 0 1 1 2 3 5 8
If the user enters 0 or a negative number:


Enter the number of Fibonacci sequence terms to print: -3
Error: the number of terms must be a positive integer.
